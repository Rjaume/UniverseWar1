# UniverseWar1
A space game which started as a university project, I have been developing it since September 2021.
I am currently working on the mechanics therefore the gameplay is not extremely exciting yet, right now the goal is staying alive as long as possible. 

My objective is to develop it into a rogue-like game which will be based on advancing through a map while killing enemies and improving the player's spaceship.
