A space game, which I have been developing since September 2021. It started as a project for a university subject.
Currently I am still working on the mechanics therefore the gameplay is not extremely exciting, right now the goal is to be able to stay alive as long as possible. My objective is to develop it into a rogue-like game which will be based on advancing through a map while killing enemies and improving the player's spaceship.
